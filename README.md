  This project is used to track all financial transactions for a business or for personal use. It tracks deposits, payments, and time logs for any transactions inputted onto a file named transactions.csv. Not only that, but it includes a ledger that records and filters the transactions on the transactions.csv file. You can only exit through the "X" option.

  Screenshot 926 displays an interesting piece of code over getting the FilterToMonth filter. By splitting the String calendar, it allows me to use each date value as an int and compare to the local time. The (calendar != null == true) allows the process to go through without null values being displayed as null values are considered "false".
