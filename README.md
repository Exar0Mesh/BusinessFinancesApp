  This project is used to track all financial transactions for a business or for personal use. It tracks deposits, payments, and time logs for any transactions inputted onto a file named transactions.csv. Not only that, but it includes a ledger that records and filters the transactions on the transactions.csv file. You can only exit through the "X" option.
